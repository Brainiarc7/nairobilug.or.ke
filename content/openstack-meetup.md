Summary: The first OpenStack meetup in Nairobi

If I had to describe [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) succinctly I'd say *next-gen virtualization*; it's not magic (although you **can** use [Juju](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Get_OpenStack#Juju)).  I know many OpenStackers probably cringe when I reduce this large, distributed, open-source software stack with hundreds (thousands?) of committers around the world to *just* virtualization, but allow me to explain...

[Adam Nelson](https://twitter.com/varud) gave an introduction to OpenStack last week at iHub Kenya.  The room was filled with developers, sales people, and systems admins, and everyone had their jaws dropped to the floor as Adam created VMs, snapshotted their disks, deleted files, retrieved them, cloned security groups, etc.  People like magic tricks (illusions?), but I'm a sysadmin, so I don't believe in magic. ;)

Value proposition:

* Your servers are under utilized, *use them more intelligently*.
* Procurement of hardware is inefficient (especially in Africa!), *make better use of what you have*.
* Your customers are in Africa, *why is your content in the US*?
